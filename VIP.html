                <h3>Electronic ARTrium</h3>
                <p><strong>Team Goal:</strong> Design and build an interesting and engaging interactive sensor-driven dynamic art 
                    installation. The installation consists of a combination of three kinds of original art — sound, mechatronics, 
                    and video — that all respond to participant motion in a synchronized way. Key points in participants’ poses, 
                    extracted in real time from camera output, are processed and then streamed over Ethernet to control the images, 
                    sound, and mechatronic movement. The goal is to give the participants a sense of wonder and intrigue as they 
                    experiment with how their body movements change the art.</p>

                    <h3>Language & Identity in the New South</h3>
                    <p><strong>Team Goal:</strong> This VIP offers data to understand English as spoken by diverse populations in 
                        Georgia.  We produce academic articles and presentations about regional and ethnic language variation; change 
                        over time; and accents as signifiers of identity and attitudes.  Students develop skills in human subjects 
                        research, sociolinguistic theory, phonetic measurements, statistics, data science, and academic literacy. 
                        The team fosters a welcoming socio-intellectual community and a growth mindset, encouraging 
                        humanities-confident students to learn technical tools and inviting computing-confident students to appreciate 
                        the social richness of language data.
